###BCH Encoder and Decoder 
####With full commmunication simulation
- bch_encode7.m, bch_decode7.m are functions that do BCH(15,7) encoding and decoding
- bch_encode11.m, bch_decode11.m are functions that do BCH(15,11) encoding and decoding
- bsc_apoorv.m is a Binary Symmetric Channel simulation
- bch7comm.m is a communication simulation with BCH(15,7) coding. See code to change the probability of error in the channel
- bch11comm.m is a communication simulation with BCH(15,11) coding. See the code to change the probability of error in the channel
- Both require a wav file, by default it will take tata.wav as input and output the sound
